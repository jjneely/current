                       Current Server TODO List

*     Minor nit
**    Potential problem
***   Cleanup needed
****  Bug
***** Nasty nasty nasty

***** Merge up the 1.1 tree's SQL backend, and start squealing.

***** Improve cadmin's code to the point where it doesn't suck.
      cadmin will split into cadmin, which acutally talks to the server
      itself through current.* api calls, and install.py, which gets enough
      of the server setup to deal with current.* api calls.
  
***** redo the logging so that current.log is empty for log_level 0 and 
      perhaps 1 - access_log and error_log are all we need there.
      Keep error_log very small at 0, and still quiet at 1.

***** The logger probably needs to switch to string based levels, for 
   implementation/namespace reasons. 

*** we ignore channel versions during create/delete/listpackage. Fix that.
    Old channel versions might need to live for up to an hour, to give 
    "logged in" clients a chance to expire.

** Fixup the perms checking code, and move it to the backend.

** When we update, we should set a flag to only bump the channel version 
   if we actually changed soemthing.

* Instead of using a python based PythonTypeHandler setting the compression
  headers, we could do a more advanced config with mod_header and set
  the headers automatically for any listPackage or getPackageHeader request

  mod_asis could probably also do this work, but I think mod_header 
  would be better.

* Cleanup terminology - its either an rpm, or a package. Pick one, change
  the rest. Its a package.

* labelCompare wants None as the epoch component, not "" (empty string)
  we have a helper function, which is wrong, but thats ok, as we don't 
  use it. narf.

* Figure out how the heck to do sub-channels. Have to resolve deps using 
  the sub-channel and its parent.

* In the new web based, database backed current administrative system
  (which does't exist) it would be cool to include mod_status and 
  mod_config information.
