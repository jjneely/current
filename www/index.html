<h3>An open source server for Red Hat's up2date tools.</h3>

<p> Red Hat's up2date is a suite of tools (sometimes called the Red Hat
Network) for keeping a Red Hat Linux system "up to date" with new
security/bugfix RPM's.  It also allows you to add completely new rpm's to
clients over the network. The tools do a thorough job of handling bootloader
configurations, new kernels, packages dependancies and conflicts.
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, Red Hat has not released their server, which does not
fully address the needs of some users/departments. Thus, 'Current' was born.
 (current == up2date - more bad puns may follow).
</p>


<p> Current is primarily intended for the
small to medium organization that wants to control the RPMs installed on its
machines. It's completely useless for the single computer at home that needs
security patches (just use RHN - its free for the first computer).
</p>

<p> Right now, Current is release quality.
The API used by up2date v2.7 and v2.8 is working in the basic mode (grab
packages, list available packages, find what packages this
computer needs updated). It doesn't attempt any of the more advanced
management features that RHN provides. The current (pun intended) plan
(better laid out in the roadmap.txt file in the package) is to
become a complete anonymous server solution for 1.X, and then tackle the
more advanced features of RHN.
</p>

<p>Current is implemented using apache, mod_python, and mod_ssl. This is 
an excellent fit, as that what RHN uses. :)
