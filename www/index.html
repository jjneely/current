<h3>An open source server for Red Hat's up2date tools.</h3>

<p> Red Hat's up2date is a suite of tools (sometimes called the Red Hat
Network) for keeping a Red Hat Linux system "up to date" with new
security/bug fix RPMs.  It also allows you to add completely new RPMs to
clients over the network. The tools do a thorough job of handling boot-loader
configurations, new kernels, packages dependencies and conflicts.
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, Red Hat has not released their server, which does not
fully address the needs of some users/departments. Thus, 'current' was born.
</p>


<p> Current is primarily intended for the small to medium organization that
wants to control the RPMs installed on its machines. It's completely useless
for the single computer at home that needs security patches (just use RHN -
its free for the first computer). Its also not going to scale to the level
of RHN - but for a thousand hosts or less, its reasonable. </p>

<p> Right now, current v1.4 is release quality. The API used by up2date v2.7
and v2.8 is working for gui and text interfaces in the basic mode (grab
packages, list available packages, find what packages this computer needs
updated). It doesn't attempt any of the more advanced management features
that RHN provides. The current (pun intended) plan (better laid out in the
roadmap.txt file in the package) is to become a complete anonymous server
solution for 1.X, and then tackle the more advanced features of RHN. </p>

<p>Current is implemented using apache, mod_python, and mod_ssl. This is 
an excellent fit, as that what RHN uses. :) Naturally, Red Hat has nothing to 
do with this project, except to release excellent client packages. Please
don't bother them with bug reports if you are using current.
