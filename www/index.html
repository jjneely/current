<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>To completely implement a correct server for all of Red Hat's excellent
up2date tools. Current is not expected to scale to the same mammoth
proportions, but it should be fast enough and capable enough to support
several hundred machines without driving the sysadmins mad.</p>


<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Production quality for 2.7 to 4.3 clients with a Fedora Core 1, 2, 3, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, or 4 server.</li>
    <li>Full SQL database backend.</li>
    <li>As easy to setup for the admin as we can make it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Downloads and Documentation</h3>

<ul>

    <li><p><b><a href="current-guid/">Current Manual</a> - </b>This is the
    manual as shipped with 1.6.0.  This should contain full blown
    instructions for everything in Current.  Of course it doesn't, but
    you are welcome to patch the DocBook source in the Current tar balls,
    cvs, or svn.</p></li>
    
    <li>
    <p><b>Releases -</b> All source code and RPM packages of Current 
    releases can be downloaded from the <a href="http://current.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents and Files</a> section.</p></li>

    
    <li><p><b>Source Code Control -</b>
The source is stored in tigris.org's CVS system. Please see the help menu
to the left (or click on the Source Code link at the top left) to get 
or browse our CVS repository.</p>
<p>As of October 4th, 2004 I have moved the main development over to a
Subversion server.  To take part in active development you will want to 
get the latest source code by pointing your web browser or your Subversion
client to <a href="https://svn.linux.ncsu.edu/svn/slack/trunk/current">
    https://svn.linux.ncsu.edu/svn/slack/trunk/current</a>.  Releases
will still be committed to Tigris's CVS system.</p>

<li><p><b>FTP -</b>
Hunter's Current ftp repository 
<a href="ftp://ftp.biology.duke.edu/admin/current">here</a>.
Jack's Current ftp repository is 
<a href="ftp://ftp.quackmaster.net/current">here</a>.
</p></li>

</ul>


<h3>Dependancies</h3>

<p>Current does require a few things to run.  Fortunately, any of the Red 
Hat or Fedora Core distributions have everything you need to get Current
working in some form or another.  The above distributions all include
Python, mod_python, RPM, Apache, and a database Current knows how to use.
However, Current intends to support several different databases. 
Below are the names of the databases that we intend to make
Current work with.  Hyperlinks are used if these packages are missing
from some distributions.  Also, Current only uses SQL databases
in version 1.5.x and above.</p>

<ul>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li><a href="http://dag.wieers.com/packages/sqlite/">SQLite</a> and
    <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/packages/python-sqlite/">pySQLite</a></li>
</ul>
    

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>To discuss ideas, bug fixes, or submit patches then join the development 
<a href="http://current.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">
mailing list</a>. If your patch implements an existing RFE or fixes a known
BUG, you can also/instead attach it to our 
<a href="http://current.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">
    Issue Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>
You can usually find one of us on IRC on irc.freenode.net in #current. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to add a bug/rfe/whatever to the 
<a href="http://current.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a> 
without registering with tigris.org, just send them to the dev or users list. 
(If you are registered, you do not have to join current.)
We'll add it.</p>


<h3>Future Directions</h3>
<p>
Naturally, supporting new versions of the client and making current work
on newer releases of Red Hat Linux are a priority. Other areas we look 
forward to:</p>

<ul>
    <li> <p>Client Monitoring: <br />
    Before we move into client management features, lets get a website 
    working with Current and display of information and statistics of
    all the clients we know about.
    </p></li>

<li><p> Basic client management: <br />
Once we have the basics complete in the SQL backend (to support the same
modes of use we have now) we naturally want to start supporting at least
the basic client management features available in up2date. This includes 
full push (rhnsd/rhn_check) and being able to "group" clients together.
Naturally, this has to follow the 1.5.x/1.6.x release.</p></li>

<li><p> To infinity, and beyond: <br />
Applet support, full HTML driven management interfaces, full errata
annoucements, "proxy" server like support, there are literally dozens of
really useful features in up2date that we can support, if only we write
enough python. :)</p></li>

</ul>
<p></p>
