Design / scratch document for the PostgreSQL schema for the 1.5 series

This design will be stringly based on Toby's 1.1 schema, with changes
necessitated by shelve implementation changes in 1.3.x

TABLES:
NameIndex (
	filename
	packagename
	arch 
	release
	epoch 
	version
	size)
SourceIndex (
	srcfilename
	packagename
	arch )
DependFiles (
	package
	dependsOnFilename )
DependPackages (
	package
	dependsOnPackage )
Provides (
	name
	flags
	vers )
Obsoletes (
	name
	flags
	vers )
Files (
	pkgname
	filename )
Channel (
	channelName
	rpmPackageName )

This is a basic list of what the first-revision would look like.  We're not
going to try to put it into some sort of normal form.

Note: This lists the types as well - some of the 'text' fileds could probably
be char(X)'s instead for speed...

PackageName (
	int pkgNum
	text pkgName
	);
		This table lists the package names (i.e. 'kernel')
RPMPackages (
	int pkgNum
	text filename
	text version
	text release
	text epoch
	text arch
	int size
	);
		This provides information on binary RPM packages
SRPMPackages (
	int pkgNum
	text filename
	);
		This provides information on source RPM packages
Files (
	int fileNum
	text fileName
	);
		This lists files within the packages (not filenames of
		packages)
DependFiles (
	int fileNum
	int pkgNum
	);
		This correlates file dependency information
DependPackages (
	int pkgNum
	int pkgNum
	);
		This correlates package dependency information
Provides (
	int provideNum
	text name
	text flags
	text vers
	);
		This stores information on what resources are provided
Obsoletes (
	int obsoleteNum
	text name
	text flags
	text vers
	);
		This stores information on what resources are obsoleted
PkgProvides (
	int pkgNum
	int provideNum
	);
		This correlates provision with package doing the providing
PkgObsoletes (
	int pkgNum
	int obsoleteNum
	);
		This correlates obsoletion with package doing the obsoleting
Channels (
	int channelNum
	text channelId
	int parentChannelNum
	text channelName
	text channelLabel
	text channelArch
	text channelRelease
	text channelDescription
	time channelLastUpdated
	);
		This lists the channels available
PkgChannels (
	int pkgNum
	int channelNum );
		This tells what packages are in what channels

Obviously, this is a first run only, isn't SQL code, and doesn't have any sort
if indices or anything...  comments?
