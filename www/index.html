<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>To create an Open Source package management server for RPM based 
distributions.  Our aim is to be able to do what the Red Hat Network did for
Red Hat products to any Linux distribution.
A part of this is to implement a server for Red Hat's
up2date tools, extend the functionality of Yum, and be able to scale to 
thousands of machines.</p>


<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Production quality Up2date server for 2.7 to 4.4 clients with a Fedora Core 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, or 4 server.</li>
    <li>Full SQL database backend.</li>
    <li>TurboGears Web Interface in the devel series.</li>
    <li>As easy to setup for the admin as we can make it.</li>
</ul>

    <li><b>[1 November 2006] Help with TurboGears</b>
    <p>The Current project is looking for someone that would like to work
    on the <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/index.html">TurboGears</a>
    web interface.  Especially web design and looking up the TG controllers
    to the Current API.  If you are interested please email the 
    developers' list.</p></li>

    <li><b>[23 September 2006] Current 1.7.6</b>
    <p>The code path for scanning channels was busted in 1.7.5 so here is
    1.7.6.  This also has some code to reconnect to MySQL when the database
    connection times out.  The database records more meta information about
    each client and that is reflected in the TG web interface.</p></li>

    <li><b>[14 September 2006] Current 1.7.5</b>
    <p>Current now has user authentication (but not authorization yet).
    To use the <tt>cadmin.py</tt> command you must first login by using
    the <tt>login</tt> cadmin command.  The Current extended parts of the
    XMLRPC API now require a session argument.  The tarball has a TurboGears
    web interface in the <tt>cwebapp/</tt> directory.  See the
    <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>.</p></li>

    <li><b>[06 August 2006] Current 1.7.4</b>
    <p>Basic support for Yum is included.  The repositories have Yum's repomd
    metadata added and a Yum plugin exists that will register a client
    and allow the client to download files from the Current server.  Requires
    Yum 2.9.3 or better.</p></li>

    <li><b>[07 July 2006] Current 1.7.3</b>
    <p>Lots of churn.  No more web interface.  There are better ways
    to do that than what I had done.  No more makefiles, we now use Python's
    distutils.  First shot at authenticated, tracked clients and multiple
    channels.  See the <a href="http://current.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=announce&msgNo=15">
    release announcement</a> for full details.</p></li>

    <li><b>[23 Jul 2005] Current 1.6.1</b>
    <p>A new release in the stable 1.6 series.  This fixes a few bugs from
    Issue Tracker and adds support for versions of Up2date that ship with Fedora
    Core 4.</p></li>
    
    <li><b>[21 Mar 2005] Current 1.6.0 Final</b>
    <p>Its here!  Current 1.6.0 Final.  Only some documentation
    tweeks when compared to 1.5.91.  Y'all let me know how it
    breaks.</p></li>
    
    <li><b>[04 Oct 2004] New Maintainer, New Development Version</b>
    <p>Jack Neely is the new maintainer for the Current project.  Hunter
    is still on board and we are working together as co-maintainers.  I
    think Current is a worthy project and would like to see it continue.</p>
    <p>I've beaten CVS head into submission and am releasing a new 
    development version 1.5.6 with a re-worked database layer.</p></li>

    <li><p><b><a href="current-guide/">Current Manual</a> - </b>This is the
    manual as shipped with 1.6.0.  This should contain full blown
    instructions for everything in Current.  Of course it doesn't, but
    you are welcome to patch the DocBook source in the Current tar balls,
    cvs, or svn.</p></li>
    
    <li>
    <p><b>Releases -</b> All source code and RPM packages of Current 
    releases can be downloaded from the <a href="http://current.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents and Files</a> section.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Source Code Control -</b>
    The source is stored in tigris.org's Subversion system. Please see the help 
    menu or click on the "Subversion" link at the top left to  
    browse our Subversion repository.  Read only access to the actual
    SVN repository is granted to folks that have an Observer roll in this
    project.</p>

    <p>Between October 4, 2004 and July 22 2005 I did a lot of work with 
    a personal Subversion server as I waited for Tigris to upgrade their 
    systems.  If you would like access to the history and information stored
    in that SVN server please go here:
    <a href="https://svn.linux.ncsu.edu/svn/slack/trunk/current">https://svn.linux.ncsu.edu/svn/slack/trunk/current</a>.
    As of July 22, 2005 the Tigris SVN resources are now the primary SCM for
    Current.</p></li>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p><b>New for Current 1.7 - </b> Current versions 1.7 and up require
mod_python 3.1 and Python 2.3.  Current should be able to run 
out of the box on RHEL 4, RHEL 4 rebuilds, and FC3 or better.
The TurboGears web interface in the requires TurboGears 0.8.9 and
Python 2.4.
</p>

<p><b>All Current Versions - </b> Current does require a few things to run.  
Fortunately, any of the Red 
Hat or Fedora Core distributions have everything you need to get Current
working in some form or another.  The above distributions all include
Python, mod_python, RPM, Apache, and a database Current knows how to use.
However, Current intends to support several different databases. 
Below are the names of the databases that we intend to make
Current work with.  Also, Current only uses SQL databases
in version 1.5.x and above.</p>

<ul>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li>SQLite and python-sqlite (See Fedora Extras)</li>
</ul>

We'll add it.</p>


<h3>Future Directions</h3>
<p>
A lot of thought has gone into where to take Current.  The writing on the wall
is clear that an RHN-alike is just not the way to go.  The Linux community 
needs a tool that is to system administration as Yum/Up2date are to package
deployment.  One of our primary goals will be to bring automated management
to Yum based systems by providing an Action Agent similar to rhnsd that
can work on non-up2date machines.  Here are some specifics to what we
are working toward.
</p>

<ul>

    <li>Yum Support</li>

    <li>Action Agent: A client agent that communicates with the Current server.  
    Able to
    report the status of the machine and run a specific set of Actions. 
    This client will be separate from Up2date and aimed at systems using
    Yum.</li>
    
    <li>Client Monitoring:  Display in a web tool known information about
    each system.
    </li>

    <li>Basic client management: 
    This includes 
    full push (rhnsd/rhn_check) and being able to "group" clients together.
    </li>

    <li>To infinity, and beyond: <br />
Applet support, full HTML driven management interfaces, full errata
announcements, "proxy" server like support, etc.  Similar support using
the Current Action Agent instead of the up2date tools.</li>

</ul>
