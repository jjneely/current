<section id="database"><title>Setting up your database</title>
<para>
The database backend is now a critical part of a functioning Current server.
Setting up the database is not difficult, but care
must be taken to not only ensure it's done correctly, but that it's done in a
way which won't compromise security.  In any and all cases please consult
the documentation for the database that you choose to use to make sure
that you are running it in a secure fashion.  
</para>
<para>
A common question is what database to use.  This very much depends on how
much work you are willing to do to set up and maintain your Current server
and what your specific needs are.  Each database has pros and cons.
The PostgreSQL database is the recommeded database for a large number of
clients.  It handles transactions and locking very well.  The SQLite database
is easy to set up and works well for a small number of clients and can
be quite fast.  MySQL is supported as well but a 4.x or 5.x version is
recommended.
</para>

<para>
Now that you have decided what database to use it is important
to tell Current to use that database.  Edit the Current configuration file
which, in the default setup, is <filename>/etc/current/current.conf</filename>.
Set the <quote>db_type</quote> to the proper database.  Valid values are
<quote>postgres</quote>, <quote>pysqlite</quote>, and <quote>mysql</quote>.
The <quote>db_user</quote>, <quote>db_pass</quote>, <quote>db_name</quote>,
and the <quote>db_host</quote> values also need to be configured for your
database.
</para>
<section id="postgres"><title>The PostgreSQL Backend</title>
<para>
There are two parts to setting up the PostgreSQL backend; first you have to
set up the PostgreSQL server itself to accept connections properly, then
you have to set up the actual database instance your Current server will use.
We'll address them in that order.
</para>
<para>
In order to set up the daemon, you have to first have an established
<filename>/var/lib/pgsql/data</filename> directory.  This is done by simply
starting the PostgreSQL daemon and immediately stopping it.  Then, you
have to configure the daemon to accept network (TCP/IP) connections.  This is
done by editing two files in the <filename>/var/lib/pgsql/data</filename>
directory, <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> and
<filename>postmaster.opts.default</filename>.
</para>
<para>
The <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file configures the method(s) used
to authenticate connections to the PostgreSQL service; for Current to work,
we must allow host-based authentication, which is what is used for TCP/IP
connections.  The simplest way of doing this is to add a line to the
end of this file that reads:
<screen>
host    all     127.0.0.1   255.255.255.255     password
</screen>
This allows host-based connections over TCP/IP from the local host only
(the loopback adapter, specifically) to all databases with a valid password
supplied.
</para>
<para>
The host-based authentication method is mainly for cases when the database
server is not the same machine as the Current server.  For security conserns
you should only allow the IP address that need to connect to your
database server.  If you are running the database on the same machine as
Current you can also set up local, socket based authentication.  Connections
are then handled through an on-disk socket rather than the network.  Local
authentication can be enabled by using a line that reads:
<screen>
local   all         all           password
</screen>
This allows socket based connections using a password.  In any case, the 
default IDENT based authentication will not work without a local IDENT
server.  For more details about configuring these access methods and
permissions, please see the <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Documentation</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
The next file, <filename>postmaster.opts.default</filename>, simply tells the
startup script what options to pass to the postmaster daemon when the
PostgreSQL service is started.  Please be very careful to modify the
<filename>postmaster.opts.default</filename> file, even if there isn't one in
existence already - the <filename>postmaster.opts</filename> file simply
records what options the daemon was started with the last time it was started,
it does not control the options.
</para>
<para>
If you have any preexisting options in this file, you should keep them.  You
will have to add a <quote>-i</quote> to this file if it's not already there if
you decide to
allow TCP/IP connections to the server.
</para>
<para>
Once you've modified those files, you can re-start the PosrgreSQL service and
create the user that the Current server will use to connect to the database.
This user and password must be the same username and password that appear in
your <filename>current.conf</filename> file.  The easiest way to create this
user account is to run the <command>createuser</command> script with the
<quote>-P</quote> option.  Please note that you must use a capital "P" -
the lowercase "p" is a different option and will cause unexpected behavior.
For more information on creating PostgreSQL users, please see the 
<ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Documentation</ulink>.
</para>
<para>Now that we've allowed TCP/IP connections and created our user, we need
to create the database and tables that Current will use.  First, you need to
create and empty database with the <quote>createdb</quote> command provided
by the PostgreSQL package.  Once the empty database has been created, you will
create the actual tables that Current will use.  This step has been
simplified for you; all you need to do is run the <command>cinstall initdb</command>
command and the tables will be created automatically.  If you receive any error
messages, they should be somewhat explicit about what went wrong.  If you're
unable to correct the error, please ask on the mailing list.
</para>

<section id="pysqlite"><title>The SQLite Backend</title>
<para>
The SQLite backend is the easiest to set up and run with Current.  It 
supports transactions well but will not work well with more than
a handful of clients.  As of this writing SQLite 2.8 and Python-SQLite 
0.5.0 are the versions used for testing.  SQLite 3 should work better
for handling more clients.  Also, SQLite is what I do most of my development
with.
</para>

<para>
Make sure that you have the RPMs for SQLite and Python-SQLite (the python
bindings) installed.  Links to RPMs can be found from the Current
website.  After they are installed set the Current configuration file to
use the <quote>pysqlite</quote> database.  The <quote>db_type</quote>
value in the configuration file is the only database parameter used for SQLite.
You may leave the rest blank.  Finally, run the command
as root <command>cinstall initdb</command>.  You database should now
be setup and ready to use.  The actual file Current will keep at
<filename>/export/current/db/current.sqlite</filename>.
</para>
<para>
That's it.  Your are done setting up the SQLite database.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>The MySQL Backend</title>
<para>
The MySQL database will preform better the newer your version of the 
database code is.  I'm testing with the versions that come with Fedora
Core and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, currently 3.23.58.  Although this
version does work and should work for a large number of clients it
does not support transactions.  It is recommended that you run a version
(4.x or greater) that supports transactions.
</para>
<para>
Install MySQL from the RPMs of the version of your choice and start up
the database.  Run the <command>mysql</command> as the MySQL root user.
We will manually create a database and create a user that has read/write
access.  Please check out the MySQL documentation for security concerns.
<screen>
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 157 to server version: 3.23.58

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create database up2date;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES  on *.* to 'bob'@'localhost' ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql>
</screen>

You should now be able to configure Current to connect to this MySQL
server with these parameters in your configuration file.
<screen>
db_type = mysql
db_user = bob
db_pass =
db_name = up2date
db_host = localhost
</screen>

If your MySQL server runs on a different host than your Current server
you will have to update the GRANT statement to reflect the host that
Current will be connecting from.
