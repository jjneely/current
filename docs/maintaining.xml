The larger part of server tree maintenance has been obsoleted by the new
SQL-based model.  At the time of writing, all database updates are handled
through the Apache server, so Apache should never need to shut down.
Likewise, all <command>cadmin</command> commands are executed through the 
Apache server.  We have not yet tested performing database updates while
clients are actively connected; please test this functionality with care.

  You need to run <command>cadmin scan_channel</command> with the proper
  channel labels when your server trees change.  Most people set this
  up as part of the cron job that updates the trees on the server.
  This is the only maintenance that Current 1.6 needs.
