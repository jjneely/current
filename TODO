                       Current Server TODO List

*     Minor nit
**    Potential problem
***   Cleanup needed
****  Bug
***** Nasty nasty nasty

1.4 Release Critical todo list
1. Fixup open/update in cadmin
2. Make check_db also check perms
3. Make the makefile build the docs
4. make the spec file install the docs
5. Make some kind of config file checker thingy
6. DONE
the logging crap can wait - people will survive at 0 right now.


* Make it so that we can checkdb the whole db at once

* Maybe make it so we can update the whole db at once

***** redo the logging so that current.log is empty for log_level 0 and 
      perhaps 1 - access_log and error_log are all we need there.
      Keep error_log very small at 0, and still quiet at 1.

**** Add perms checking code to cadmin to _warn_ of possible perms problems.

*** With apache doing the work, some of the database can go away.
    Leave it - we'll just blow away the shelve backend later.

* Instead of using a python based PythonTypeHandler setting the compression
  headers, we could do a more advanced config with mod_header and set
  the headers automatically for any listPackage or getPackageHeader request

  mod_asis could probably also do this work, but I think mod_header 
  would be better.

** standalone.callAPIMethod() should get connInfo separately, to make 
   logging prettier

*** we ignore channel versions during create/delete/listpackage. Fix that.
    Old channel versions might need to live for up to an hour, to give 
    "logged in" clients a chance to expire.

** Clean up the doc directory.


* Cleanup terminology - its either an rpm, or a package. Pick one, change
  the rest. Its a package.

* labelCompare wants None as the epoch component, not "" (empty string)
  we have a helper function, which is wrong, but thats ok, as we don't 
  use it. narf.

***** Improve cadmin's code to the point where it doesn't suck.
  
** The logger probably needs to switch to string based levels, for 
   implementation/namespace reasons. Or ditch it completely in 
   mod_python.

* When we get an invalid sysid, look at the system_id field - if its from
  RHN or openup, report a different error message (wrong server dude) than
  if its just a bogus sysid. Email AL and PB about adding similar code to
  their servers.

* Figure out how the heck to do sub-channels. Have to resolve deps using 
  the sub-channel and its parent.

* See if the ConfigParser class can support [section] names with periods,
  and then the section name could _BE_ the label value for a channel. 
  Config seems like it ought to be simple to get right, but is in fact an
  ever loving cast iron ... well, you know.

  Use the ConfigPaser from python v2.2

* In the new web based, database backed current administrative system
  (which does't exist) it would be cool to include mod_status and 
  mod_config information.
