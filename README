                Current - a server for Red Hat's up2date

Current is an open source implementation of a server to interact with the
Up2date Agent shipped in Red Hat Linux.  Everything is implemented for a
basic, anonymous only system. We are working to extend support for
non-anonymous (fully managed) setups.

If you have an existing Current setup, you MUST read the RELEASE_NOTES file
from version to version to see whats changed (config, setup, need to rebuild
database, whatever). If you are interested in the low-level details, please
read the CHANGELOG. The docs directory contains the longer documentation for
new sites or reference. The TODO file and the roadmap.txt file will tell you
where we are going.


Basically, the functionality of 1.0 is enough to get a small network (20-50
 clients) updated with basic security patches. 1.4 is scalable enough to
take this basic, anonymous only functionality to several hundred hosts
(we predict).

There is a freshmeat entry (yay!) and a website at
http://www.biology.duke.edu/computer/unix/current. There is a link to the
mailing list from the web page.

Comments to the mailing list please. Bug reports should contain enough
detail to help me see what the problem is. Patches always cheerfully looked
at.

  NOTE: !WARNING! ACHTUNG- This server should be carefully tested and
  monitored before being trusted with production clients (workstations OR
  servers). Closed driver on professional course.  Do not attempt these
  maneuvers. Always wear your seatbelt.
  

Status:
    rhn_register:
        Current  can handle rhn_register versions of 1.3.x through at least
        2.7.21.  For rhn_register this means generating a usable system id
        and not crashing the client.  (IE, all the API functions are at
        least stubbed out)

        Both the GUI and text interfaces are supported.

        Note that rhn_register disappears in the limbo betas, consumed 
        by the up2date package itself.
        
    up2date:
        Working 2.7.x (tested 2.7.2, 2.7.11, 2.7.86) for all simple cases
        (it works here). Versions prior to 2.7 will not be supported.

        Both the GUI and text interfaces are supported. (the gui has 
        one extra call it can make, which is implemented in a limited way).

        2.9.x (in limbo betas) does have 1 extra call that is not supported
        yet. (It looks like we have that data in the database, we just 
        need to code an extra API for it)

    rhn_check / rhnsd:
        Not working. (rhnsd just calls rhn_check).

    rhn-applet:
        Not working. (new api, haven't looked at it yet)

PS. Since one cretin has already asked, NO, I will not help you try and
'hack' the RHN system. I'm pretty familiar with the authentication
mechanisms by now, and they're good. If I do find a bug (and I have), I'll
report it to RH long before you see it here. Go away.

AL and CG are still smarter than you are anyway. :)
