                       Current Server TODO List

* redo the logging so that current.log is empty for log_level 0 and
  perhaps 1 - access_log and error_log are all we need there.
  Keep error_log very small at 0, and still quiet at 1.
 
* we ignore channel versions during create/delete/listpackage. Fix that.
  Old channel versions might need to live for up to an hour, to give
  "logged in" clients a chance to expire.
 
* labelCompare wants None as the epoch component, not "" (empty string)
  we have a helper function, which is wrong, but thats ok, as we don't
  use it. narf.
 
* The logger probably needs to switch to string based levels, for
  implementation/namespace reasons.

* Fixup the perms checking code, and move it to the backend.

* When we update, we should set a flag to only bump the channel version 
   if we actually changed something.

* Cleanup terminology - its either an rpm, or a package. Pick one, change
  the rest. Its a package.

* labelCompare wants None as the epoch component, not "" (empty string)
  we have a helper function, which is wrong, but thats ok, as we don't 
  use it. narf.

* Figure out how the heck to do sub-channels. Have to resolve deps using 
  the sub-channel and its parent.

* In the new web based, database backed current administrative system
  (which does't exist) it would be cool to include mod_status and 
  mod_config information.


1.6.0 ship checklist

More Code cleanups in general
Move all the db portable code from postgres.py to currentdb.py
Remove the src/bin distinction 
Make the scanning recursive.
Add cadmin API calls for querying
Add input checking into cadmin
Clean up the cmd line parsing in cadmin
Redo the deps handling in the database
Check on the use of transactions (where, how many, etc)

and poof, we're done. <sigh>
