# Example Current config file
#

# General guidelines:
# 1. Every current.conf must have a "current" section, which is the 
#    main config section.
# 2. Section name rule -> '-', '_', alphanum
# 3. field name rule  -> '-', '.', '_', alphanum
# 4. All fields must be present, even if blank.
# 

# General Section descriptions:
# [current]
# valid_channels = list of all the channel labels to actually use. This
#                  allows the admin to define a channel for future use, or
#                  disable an old channel without deleting anything.
#
# log_file = File to send log messages to
#
# log_level = How much should we send to the log file?
#
# apache_config_file = file to put apache/mod_python configuration 
#                      in. Should be included in httpd.conf
#
# access_check_type = How should checkperms tell if you have your permissions
#                     set correctly? Values are:
#                     None  -- perform no check
#                     User  -- assume user in 'access_check_arg' has read
#                     Group -- assume group in 'access_check_arg' has read
#                     All   -- assume everyone can read
#                     For all or none, the argument is not used 
#                 John, update docs for setting this string.
#
# access_check_arg  = If access_check_type is set to user or group, the 
#                     arg specifies WHICH user or group to check. 
#                     Should be a valid user name or group name. 'apache' is 
#                     by far the most common value for either.
#                 John, update docs for setting this string.
#
# server_secret = text to get sha1'd for systemid tokens. 
#                 Must be kept secret, and site specific.
# 
#                 When debugging current problems, DON'T POST THIS TO THE 
#                 MAILING LIST.
#                 John, update docs for setting this string.
#
# server_id = maybe this should be site id if you have more than 1.
#
# welcome_message = Text for rhn_register welcome message
#
# privacy_statement = Text for rhn_register privacy statement.
#
# current_dir = directory where all the Current data is kept. Headers,
#         packages lists, dependancy data, all sorts of muck.
#         NOTE: This was per-channel in <1.3.3. Now there is one per
#         server to better accomodate mod_python usage.


# [label]
# name = Text name (human readable) name of this distribution
#        Should be only 1 line.
#
# parent_channel = Channel representing the base channel that provides most
#                  of the packages to this one, blank otherwise.
#
# arch = The cannonical architecture (a family of archs that this
#        channel supports. (i386, sparc, alpha. Not i686, etc)
#
# os_release = Release of the channel. 6.2, 7.0, 7.2, whatever.
#
# description = Textual description of what the channel represents. This 
#               can be blank or a short paragraph.
#
# rpm_dirs = list of all the dirs that contain binary rpms that should be
#            served to clients
#
# src_dirs = similarly, list of all the src rpms that should be served.
#            Can be empty, but not missing 
#
# srpm_check = Check to be sure that for every binary rpm its source rpm
#              is available.
#              Values are:
#              0 = perform no check
#              1 = warn if the source rpm isn't available
#              2 = fail if the source rpm isn't available

    This is the internet - privacy is an illusion.

    Please note that only anonymous access is supported anyway - so while you 
    have to get a valid system id (by going through the rhn_register program) 
    there is no requirement to fill those fields out with real data. :) All 
    that is required is that your architecture an os_release be accurately 
    reported - and rhn_register fills that in automatically. "
