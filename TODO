                       Current Server TODO List

* Convert to use python's logging module

* Support the capabilities in capabilities.py in the up2date code base.
  See Issue #29

* The cadmin and cinstall programs need to be reworked.  I'd like to do
  a modular approch similar to realmconfig where "cadmin foo" loads the
  foo module from a python package or random directory.  A defined
  base class is needed.  But this will make both programs nice, neat,
  cvs-ish, and easy to add functionality to.

* Exception handling throught code

* How should SRPMS be handed.  Just the latest versions on disk or all of them

* we ignore channel versions during create/delete/listpackage. Fix that.
  Old channel versions might need to live for up to an hour, to give
  "logged in" clients a chance to expire.
 
* labelCompare wants None as the epoch component, not "" (empty string)
  we have a helper function, which is wrong, but thats ok, as we don't
  use it. narf.
 
* Fixup the perms checking code, and move it to the backend.

* Figure out how the heck to do sub-channels. Have to resolve deps using 
  the sub-channel and its parent.

* In the new web based, database backed current administrative system
  (which does't exist) it would be cool to include mod_status and 
  mod_config information.

* SQL Database support.  Possible use of a third party module to make
  our lives easier to support multiple databases?

1.6.0 ship checklist

More Code cleanups in general
Move all the db portable code from postgres.py to currentdb.py
Remove the src/bin distinction 
Make the scanning recursive.
Redo the deps handling in the database
Check on the use of transactions (where, how many, etc)

and poof, we're done. <sigh>

Re-work cadmin into a text based, modular configuration system
Add input checking into cadmin
