                       Current Server TODO List

*     Minor nit
**    Potential problem
***   Cleanup needed
****  Bug
***** Nasty nasty nasty

***** redo the logging so that current.log is empty for log_level 0 and 
      perhaps 1 - access_log and error_log are all we need there.
      Keep error_log very small at 0, and still quiet at 1.

*** we ignore channel versions during create/delete/listpackage. Fix that.
    Old channel versions might need to live for up to an hour, to give 
    "logged in" clients a chance to expire.

* labelCompare wants None as the epoch component, not "" (empty string)
  we have a helper function, which is wrong, but thats ok, as we don't 
  use it. narf.

** The logger probably needs to switch to string based levels, for 
   implementation/namespace reasons.
