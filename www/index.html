Current is an open source implementation for Red Hat's up2date tools.

<h3>Mission</h3>

To completely reimplement a correct server for all of Red Hat's excellent
up2date tools. Current is not expected to scale to the same mammoth
proportions, but it should be fast enough and capable enough to support
several hundred machines without driving the sysadmins mad.
<p/>

<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Production quality for 2.7 and 2.8 clients with a Red Hat 7.x server.
<li>Experimental support for 3.0 clients and Red Hat 8.0 as a server.
<li>Full database backend in development (and working).
<li>As easy to setup for the admin as we can make it.
</ul>
<p/>

<h3>Ideas on the table</h3>
<p>
Naturally, supporting new versions of the client and making current work
on newer releases of Red Hat Linux are a priority. Other areas we look 
forward to:

<ul>
<li> Full SQL backend database: <br/>
Development is ongoing on the jwbernin-postgres-branch. The 1.5.x series will
simply reimplement the features we have now, but with a much saner SQL 
based backend (and enough changes to sanely support it). John's spearheading
this campaign.

<p/>
<li> Basic client management: <br/>
Once we have the basics complete in the SQL backend (to support the same
modes of use we have now) we naturally want to start supporting at least
the basic client management features available in up2date. This includes 
full push (rhnsd/rhn_check) and being able to "group" clients together.
Naturally, this has to follow the 1.5.x/1.6.x release.

<p/>
<li> To infinity, and beyond: <br/>
Applet support, full HTML driven management interfaces, full errata
annoucements, "proxy" server like support, there are literally dozens of
really useful features in up2date that we can support, if only we write
enough python. :)

</ul>
<p/>
