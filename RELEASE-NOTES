These are the user visible changes in Current from release to release.

v1.3.12
- I've updated the 'checkdb' function of cadmin for the new db.
- New feature in cadmin 'checkperms' will try to make sure that apache
  can read all the files needed for operation. You still have to set them
  yourself, but this should help debug perms issues. This feature is 'beta'.
- The database format changed again, fixing two bugs and really improving
  transfer times of large packages. You MUST recreate your databases.
- cadmin {create,update,checkdb} will now default to
  creating/updateing/checking all the channels if you don't specify a
  particular one.
- There were a number of internal, important database changes (to reenable
  update in a sane way). Please test this version carefully.
- Fixed a long standing "flaw" in the config file - the channel label 
  is now the section name. The 'srpm_check' field in [channel] sections is
  required. The config parser now looks for these new requirements, and
  will describe the problem to the user when they run cadmin.
- Database creation / update times should be slightly faster.
- cadmin reacts well to ctrl-c by the user. 
- I very much hope that this will be the last 1.3/1.4 series changes to 
  either the database OR the config file.

v1.3.11
- The database changes in 1.3.1x mean that the cadmin commands 'update' and
  'checkdb' don't work - you simply will have to use 'create' each time
  for now. 1.3.12 will fix those.
- Reminder from 1.3.10 - the config file contents have changed (the format
  is the same, but the required fields are a little different). Please update
  your actual config file.
  db_dir, srpm_check, and current_dir are the ones to watch for.

v1.3.10 
- Mod_python support drastically improved. 
- The standalone server has been removed - it won't come back unless 
  someone can make a really good case for it. We've made the mod_python
  configuration about as painless as possible.
- Config file contents changed - you'll have to update your local config.
- The mod_python configuration changed - we now provide a 
  "create_apache_config" command in cadmin to generate the correct 
  apache configuration for you. Simply "Include" that file in your 
  httpd.conf, and you should be up and running.
- Database contents changed - you'll have to recreate all your db's.
- You MUST make sure that all the rpms, source rpms, and the directories
  where Current put its data are fully readable for the user that 
  apache runs as (typically 'apache'). Since most people run cadmin as 
  root, this will be the typical problem getting 1.3.10 to run.

v1.3.3 
- Single bug fix from 1.3.2. 

v1.3.2
- Tons of new documentation. Now available in ps/html format. 

v1.3.1
- Improvements in the new mod_python code.
- Database bug fixes mean you need to re-create your DB's with this release

v1.3.0  
- You now need apache, mod_python, and mod_ssl installed to run Current.
- You'll need to recreate your ssl certificates (or if you're ssl savy, 
  you can split the ones you have up) to work with mod_ssl.
- We provide a simple mod_python config for you to use.
- You should not have to recreate your database to use this development 
  release.
