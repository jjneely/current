<h2>General Questions</h2>

<a name="g1"/>
<h3>What versions of the up2date client API are supported?</h3>

The 2.7 version of the API is fully supported with the exception of
server-pushed actions.  The 2.5 version is no longer <!-- (and never will
 be again) --> supported. <!-- In fact, it never existed.  2.5 was all a
big government conspiracy deliberately aimed at Open Source.  These are not
the API calls you are looking for; go on about your business. --> 
2.9 APIs will be supported at some point in the near future.

<a name="g2"/>
<h3>Does the server name need to be the real name of the server (so reverse
 name lookup works) or can it be a CNAME?</h3>

<p>
SSL requires that the hostname in the SSL cert matches the A record.
So, yes, your server name needs to match the A record, at least as far as
config files and SSL certificates go. Your hostname can be whatever.
</p>

<a name="g3"/>
<h3>Why can't you run cadmin when apache is running?</h3>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> 1.3 - 1.4.x
<blockquote>

<p>
Because shelve (the python datastore used in 1.4) doesn't have any locking
or other advanced "hey, look! the data's changed/changing!" features.
Therefore, if you use cadmin while apache/current is running, you run the
risk of data corruption, screwed up clients, <a href="#t4">current not
noticing your changes</a>, etc.
</p>

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> 1.5+
<blockquote>

<p>
This is no longer an issue, as we now use a postgres backend, which has
all that database yumminess.
</p>

</blockquote>
</p>

<a name="g4"/>
<h3>What ports does the server need to have open? I have a firewall</h3>

<p>
You need to have port 443 (https) and probably 80 (http) open. Or whatever
you tell your clients, but as you're going to have to open 2 ports anyway,
you may as well just use the standard ones.
</p>

<a name="g5"/>
<h3>I want to have a Current server that supports all versions of Red Hat
Linux.  How can I populate my servers with all the necessary RPMs?</h3>

<p>
There are many <a href="http://www.redhat.com/download/mirror.html">public
mirrors</a> of the Red Hat RPMs you can use. Once you have a server, you
can mirror using:
<ul>
    <li>wget</li>
    <li>rsync</li>
    <li>others</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<a name="t1"/>
<h3>I can't get the clients to talk to the server - it never does anything, 
just gives me some ugly looking traceback on the client</h3>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> All
<blockquote>

<p>
If you get SSL errors, <em>very</em> carefully check that your RHNS-CA-CERT
file is correct. Current is now over a year old (yay!) and my test cert
just quit working - look to make sure your CA cert or server cert hasn't
expired.
</p>

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> 1.0.x (critical), 1.3+ (almost unneeded)
<blockquote>

<p>
Note the port numbers in your client and server configuration files. Two
numbers are needed (one for encrypted traffic, one for unencrypted traffic),
and while you can use any numbers you like, you have to use the same numbers
on the clients and the server, and you have to make sure you get the
ssl/non-ssl bit sorted out correctly.
</p>

<p>
The error messages for goofing this up are not very clear, and not 
something I can easily fix. If things don't work for you, make sure
<ol>
<li>your /usr/share/rhn/RHNS-CA-CERT file is correct</li>
<li>your client port numbers match your server port numbers</li>
<li>you have ssl-&gt;ssl and nonssl-&gt;nonssl correct. (8080 is non-ssl, 8081
   is ssl, by default)</li>
</ol>
</p>
 
<p>
The above 3 things account for about 70% of the complaints I get about
current not working for people.
</p>

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> 1.0.x only (1.3+ doesn't use stunnel)
<blockquote>
<p>
One admin has noticed that recent versions of stunnel are built with
libwrap/tcpwrappers support. Make certain that either you have
configured tcpwrappers AND portblocking / firewalling rules correctly
to allow your client machines to connect.
</p>

<p>
The best way to test this is to also have your server configured to be
able to run up2date/rhn_register itself. If you can run rhn_register
from your server, and it seems to work, but no other machine
can, its a firewall/security/networking issue.
</p>

<h3>I'm trying to test current, and it seems to work the first time, but
after that the clients aren't using the correct data from the server anymore
</h3>

<p>
Watch out for client side caching - I lost a full days development time
trying to figure out why the client never seemed to do more than one GET to
the server, yet still knew the "wrong" answer.  It caches darn near
everything - which is a good, desirable feature, as long as you know its
there!. Delete everything in /var/spool/up2date to get fresh hits against
the database.
</p>
  
<p>
This also explained why they bothered having database "versions" or 
last_modified values - the client will know to pull down fresh data if 
the database changes. Yes, I felt bloody stupid.
</p>


<a name="t3"/>
<h3>Some of my clients work, but some don't. I get the traceback...</h3>

<p>
This is typically caused by the clocks of the client and server being
skewed. (The root cause is a client bug). To prevent this, use rdate
or ntp to sync the clocks together. The clocks don't have to be super
accurate - &plusmn;5 minutes is fine.
</p>

<p>
This is also fixed in versions of up2date after 2.7.11 (I'm not exactly
sure of when that fix went in) - using 2.7.63 or later is what I 
recommend.
</p>

<h3>When I add packages to an existing channel, or add a new channel, 
Current doesn't seem to see them right away.</h3>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> &lt; 1.0.1
<blockquote>

<p>
Please, PLEASE, never run cadmin at the same time Current is running.
The correct way to deal with server updates is to shutdown Current, make your
changes with cadmin, and then restart Current. 'service current stop|start'
should work well for this. This was fixed in 1.0.1.
</p>

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> 1.3 - 1.4.x
<blockquote>

<p>
This is still a concern in 1.3+ - you must stop apache, use cadmin,
and then start apache - there are no exceptions.
</p>

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> 1.5+
<blockquote>
<p>
This <em>should</em> no longer be a problem with the database backend.
If you find any bugs, let us know!
</p>

</blockquote>
</p>

<a name="t5"/>
<h3>When I run cadmin/up2date, I get a traceback ending with
"xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: no element found: line 1, column 0"</h3>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> &lt; 1.4.4 and 1.5 - 1.5.5
<blockquote>

<p>
This is <a href="http://current.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=20">bug
#20</a>. If you're using the 1.4.x branch, upgrade to at least 1.4.4.
If you're using 1.5.x, upgrade to at least 1.5.5.
</p>

<p>
Even with the latest version, you're not going to see the problem on the
client side--what's happening is that the server thread crashed (an
exception was raised) and is sending a Fault (XML-RPC exception) to the
client.
</p>

<p>
You need to look at the server-side logs and see what actually happened.
<strong>That</strong> traceback is the one we need to figure out what went
wrong. You may have to increase the log level to get useful output.
</p>

<h3>When I run cadmin, I get a traceback ending with
"xmlrpclib.Fault: &lt;Fault -1: "While running 'cadmin.createChannel':
caught\nserver.apacheRequest.UnknownXML : Invalid request received (class
xmlrpc.cadmin is not defined (function = createChannel)).\n"&gt;"</h3>

<p>
<b>Version:</b> 1.5+
<blockquote>

<p>
This looks as if your server (the machine you're running cadmin create on)
is pointed at RHN's servers in the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/* config files.
For cadmin to work, the machine you run it on must be pointed at the Current
server because it now uses those config files to determine where to send its
requests.

<h3>I'm running Red Hat Linux 8.0 and I recently updated/installed apache
and [now] Current won't work</h3>

<p>
Are your logs in /var/log/httpd? If so, the permissions probably got changed
back to the default for apache packages in Red Hat Linux 8.0 and up. Because
apache drops root permissions before Current starts running and only root
can read the directory, Current can't get to its log file. Either change the
permissions back or move the log file to somewhere the apache user can reach
it. (Like /var/log)
