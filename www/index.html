<h3>Mission</h3>

To completely implement a correct server for all of Red Hat's excellent
up2date tools. Current is not expected to scale to the same mammoth
proportions, but it should be fast enough and capable enough to support
several hundred machines without driving the sysadmins mad.
<p/>


<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Production quality for 2.7 and 2.8 clients with a Red Hat 7.x/8.0 server.
<li>Experimental support for 3.0 clients.
<li>Full database backend in development (and working).
<li>As easy to setup for the admin as we can make it.
</ul>
<p/>


<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>[20 Feb 2003] Released 1.4.3</b>
<br/>
Release 1.4.3 fixes a couple of minor bugs, and provides RHL 8.0 
compatibility if you have a new enough mod_python.
Full up2date 3.0/3.1 support will be coming in 1.4.4.
<p/>

<li><b>[30 Jan 2003] Annouced the mailing list is splitting</b>
<br/>
Now that we're hosted at current.tigris.org, we can take advantage of 
the additional mailing lists provided. (And a big Thank You to Seth Vidal
at Dulug for providing our old list). Please go to the 
<a href="http://current.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">current
mailing list page</a>  to subscribe to one of the new lists. We'll gradually
transition from the old list over the next month.
<p/>

<li><b>[26 Jan 2003] Now proudly hosted at tigris.org</b>
<br/>
But if you're reading this, you probably already knew that.

(If you are registered, you do not have to join current.)
We'll add it.


<h3>Future Directions</h3>
<p>
Naturally, supporting new versions of the client and making current work
on newer releases of Red Hat Linux are a priority. Other areas we look 
forward to:

<ul>
<li> Full SQL backend database: <br/>
Development is ongoing on the trunk. The 1.5.x series will simply
reimplement the features we have now, but with a much saner SQL based
backend (and enough changes to sanely support it). John's spearheading this
campaign.

<p/>
<li> Basic client management: <br/>
Once we have the basics complete in the SQL backend (to support the same
modes of use we have now) we naturally want to start supporting at least
the basic client management features available in up2date. This includes 
full push (rhnsd/rhn_check) and being able to "group" clients together.
Naturally, this has to follow the 1.5.x/1.6.x release.

<p/>
<li> To infinity, and beyond: <br/>
Applet support, full HTML driven management interfaces, full errata
annoucements, "proxy" server like support, there are literally dozens of
really useful features in up2date that we can support, if only we write
enough python. :)

</ul>
