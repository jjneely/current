Up2date server database design

Designing some way to keep track of all the files, dependancy information, 
users, hosts, and everthing else that up2date touches on is very complex.

Multiple backends are available, and further ones are expected. This 
document will define what a backend must do.

The current_db.py file in the src/db tree defines a single object CurrentDB
that should be the base class of any backend. All of the methods in
CurrentDB marked as API calls should be implemented.

Your backend should be a full python package  (a subdirectory in the 
src/db tree) with an __init__.py. Any file names and object names may
be used in your code, however, your __init__.py should "rename" your 
base class to 'CurrentDB'.  No other constants, objects, or functions 
should be exposed.

The pysqlite backend is the 'standard' backend, and will be considered
the primary source of the API.
