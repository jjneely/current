These are the user visible changes in Current from release to release.

v1.5.0 
- Oh wow.

v1.4.4
- Current is now compatible with the new rpm API introduced in rpm v4.1,
  so current should work on any _server_ from RHL 7.2 to 9. 
- Due to documentation building dependancies, it may only build on 7.3 or
  later, but I know of no reason it won't work on 7.2 (or maybe 7.1...)
- Current is now fully compatible with all client releases from 2.7 to 
  3.1. Please report any trouble with this...
- I _HIGHLY_ recommend you upgrade to the latest errata of up2date for
  whatever release of Red Hat Linux you are running - several client bugs
  can either cause system problems or cause current to behave in bizzare
  fashions.
- cadmin with no args now does something sane.
- Improved some log messages. 1.5.x is where the major log cleanups are 
  going to occur.
- Scott Schmit submited a bug patch for our error reporting. YAY SCOTT.
  This should make diagnosing server problems much easier.
- There are no config file, apache or database changes in this release. 
  Upgrades from 1.4.3 should be clean, and do NOT require a database 
  rebuild.

v1.4.3
- Current is now proudly hosted at current.tigris.org. If you are 
  subscribed to the dulug mailing list, please move to the 
  users@current.tigris.org list instead. 
- Turns out the 3.x clients are not _fully_ supported - we missed some new 
  API calls. This will be corrected in 1.4.4.
- Added full RHL 8.0 support for the server. (As mentioned, full client 
  support for 8.0 will be in 1.4.4)
- Fixed header file generation problem caused by weirdly named rpms.
- Fixed minor mod_python bug by explicitly listing handlers we need.
- Fixed symlink creation bug, where the file was missing but the symlink 
  was already there. I hope someone tests this fix carefully...
- Requires mod_python 3.0.1 to workaround mod_python bugs. Please note that
  RHL 8.0 shipped with 3.0.0 (actually, it shipped with a CVS snapshot) 
  and this is not new enough. Until there is an errata, we'll provide a 
  src and i386 rpm for mod_python 3.0.1. This is Red Hat's phoebe beta
  rpm, built on RHL 8.0.
- Made sure the spec file would build for both 7.x based servers, and 
  8.0 based servers. (The dependancies are basically the same, but some 
  of them have changed names or been subsumed into other packages)
- Some requested documentation fixes better describing how SSL works.

v1.4.2
- Added support for 2.8 and 3.0 series clients.
- This does not mean we support running the _server_ on RHL 8.0 - just that
  I believe this all thats needed for supporting 8.0 as a client.
- Adding this support does mean you will need to recreate your database.
- If you don't have 2.8 or 3.0 clients yet (most people don't) there is 
  no reason to upgrade.
- There were some complaints about problems with the snapshot: I can't 
  reproduce them though. If you're having trouble, make sure you're active
  on the mailing list, or it won't get fixed.

v1.4.1
- Bug fixes in the Fault handling code, and cleanups about error messages
  involving the clients system id.
- You do not need to re-create your database from 1.4.0.

v1.4.0
- No visible changes from 1.3.12, EXCEPT a little database bug fixing.
- Naturally, there are huge changes from 1.0.x, now requiring apache,
  mod_python, and mod_ssl. 
- It goes without saying you will need to rebuild your database. There is
  not a need to regenerate your ssl keys for mod_ssl.

v1.3.12
- I've updated the 'checkdb' function of cadmin for the new db.
- New feature in cadmin 'checkperms' will try to make sure that apache
  can read all the files needed for operation. You still have to set them
  yourself, but this should help debug perms issues. This feature is 'beta'.
- The database format changed again, fixing two bugs and really improving
  transfer times of large packages. You MUST recreate your databases.
- cadmin {create,update,checkdb} will now default to
  creating/updateing/checking all the channels if you don't specify a
  particular one.
- There were a number of internal, important database changes (to reenable
  update in a sane way). Please test this version carefully.
- Fixed a long standing "flaw" in the config file - the channel label 
  is now the section name. The 'srpm_check' field in [channel] sections is
  required. The config parser now looks for these new requirements, and
  will describe the problem to the user when they run cadmin.
- Database creation / update times should be slightly faster.
- cadmin reacts well to ctrl-c by the user. 
- I very much hope that this will be the last 1.3/1.4 series changes to 
  either the database OR the config file.

v1.3.11
- The database changes in 1.3.1x mean that the cadmin commands 'update' and
  'checkdb' don't work - you simply will have to use 'create' each time
  for now. 1.3.12 will fix those.
- Reminder from 1.3.10 - the config file contents have changed (the format
  is the same, but the required fields are a little different). Please update
  your actual config file.
  db_dir, srpm_check, and current_dir are the ones to watch for.

v1.3.10 
- Mod_python support drastically improved. 
- The standalone server has been removed - it won't come back unless 
  someone can make a really good case for it. We've made the mod_python
  configuration about as painless as possible.
- Config file contents changed - you'll have to update your local config.
- The mod_python configuration changed - we now provide a 
  "create_apache_config" command in cadmin to generate the correct 
  apache configuration for you. Simply "Include" that file in your 
  httpd.conf, and you should be up and running.
- Database contents changed - you'll have to recreate all your db's.
- You MUST make sure that all the rpms, source rpms, and the directories
  where Current put its data are fully readable for the user that 
  apache runs as (typically 'apache'). Since most people run cadmin as 
  root, this will be the typical problem getting 1.3.10 to run.

v1.3.3 
- Single bug fix from 1.3.2. 

v1.3.2
- Tons of new documentation. Now available in ps/html format. 

v1.3.1
- Improvements in the new mod_python code.
- Database bug fixes mean you need to re-create your DB's with this release

v1.3.0  
- You now need apache, mod_python, and mod_ssl installed to run Current.
- You'll need to recreate your ssl certificates (or if you're ssl savy, 
  you can split the ones you have up) to work with mod_ssl.
- We provide a simple mod_python config for you to use.
- You should not have to recreate your database to use this development 
  release.
