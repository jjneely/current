RHN Yum Plugin
==============

As of the RHEL 5 betas Red Hat is using an RHN plugin with Yum to support
RHN with RHEL.  No more up2date.  This is a good thing.

There are several bits of the RHN protocol that the RHN plugin does 
differently.

HTTP Headers
------------

Rather than always use the headers up2date.login() returns in HTTP
GET requests the RHN plugin knows a list of specific headers to use.  This
is handled in rhnplugin.py in setupRhnHttpHeaders().  These headers that
the plugin will return to us are:

    rhn_needed_headers = ['X-RHN-Server-Id',
                          'X-RHN-Auth-User-Id',
                          'X-RHN-Auth',
                          'X-RHN-Auth-Server-Time',
                          'X-RHN-Auth-Expire-Offset']

Obviously, we must also supply these headers to the client in up2date.login().

HTTP GET Request
----------------

URLGrabber that Yum uses to fetch stuff off the web and the RHN code do not
like "$RHN" in the URLs.  This has always been an arbitrary string anyway
as far as I can tell.  Its been replaced with "GET-REQ" producing URLs
that look like:

    https://current.linux.ncsu.edu/XMLRPC/GET-REQ/realmlinux-c-4.91/repodata/repomd.xml

Repository Format
-----------------

Attempting to take the RHN protocol and morph it into something Yum can
grok is just about impossible.  The folks at Red Hat figured this out
as I did.  So, as you might guess from the URL above the directory for 
each channel (in the example 'realmlinux-c-4.91') now has a 'repodata'
directory in it.  This is very simple.  You just run the 'createrepo'
command on that directory and it litterally becomes a normal Yum 
repository with RHN's or Current's Apache access handler allowing or
denying access based on the HTTP headers.
