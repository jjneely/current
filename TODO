                       Current Server TODO List

* Gah...so the real RHN uses the following encodings with the compressed
  XMLRPC data like the listPackages.  The content-encoding is x-zlib 
  compared to x-gzip that we use.  The content-transfer-encoding
  is base64 compared to our binary.

* Support the capabilities in capabilities.py in the up2date code base.
  See Issue #29

* Exception handling throught code

* we ignore channel versions during create/delete/listpackage. Fix that.
  Old channel versions might need to live for up to an hour, to give
  "logged in" clients a chance to expire.
 
* labelCompare wants None as the epoch component, not "" (empty string)
  we have a helper function, which is wrong, but thats ok, as we don't
  use it. narf.
 
* Fixup the perms checking code, and move it to the backend.

* Figure out how the heck to do sub-channels. Have to resolve deps using 
  the sub-channel and its parent.

* In the new web based, database backed current administrative system
  (which does't exist) it would be cool to include mod_status and 
  mod_config information.


1.8.0 ship checklist

Check on the use of transactions (where, how many, etc)
Re-work cadmin into a text based, modular configuration system
Add input checking into cadmin
Clean up the cmd line parsing in cadmin
Add cadmin API calls for querying
Non-authenticated, web interface for monitoring of clients
Subchannels
